visual-search-vlm :
This project implements a visual search system using OpenAI's CLIP model. It lets users input a natural language query (e.g., "a cat on a sofa") and retrieves the most relevant images from a dataset based on semantic similarity. A simple Streamlit app is included for easy interaction

üé® Visual Search for Artwork using CLIP :
This project lets you search for artworks using simple text like:

> "a surreal painting with stars"  
> "an impressionist landscape with sunset"

It uses CLIP, a powerful AI model from OpenAI, to match your text with the most relevant images from your art dataset.
üîß How to Run It:

1. Clone the project-
git clone https://github.com/Madhumitha-07/visual-search-vlm
cd visual-search-art

2. Install the required libraries-
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Add your artwork images-
Put your .jpg or .png images inside the art_dataset/ folder.

4. Start the web app-
streamlit run app.py

üß† How It Works :
The model converts both images and your text into numbers (embeddings).
It compares how similar your text is to each image.
It shows the top 5 most similar images

üñºÔ∏è Example Queries :
"a painting of a forest in autumn"
"a digital artwork of space"
"a colorful abstract composition"
